This code is a basic Flutter application that creates a screen with a purple background color. The screen contains an app bar at the top with a black background color and the title "I Am Rich". In the body of the screen, there is a single child widget which is an Image widget displaying the Flutter logo.
 
Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import Statements:

The code imports the necessary dependencies from the Flutter framework.

Main Function:

The main() function is the entry point of the application.
It calls the runApp() function to start the app and pass it a MaterialApp widget.
MaterialApp Widget:

The MaterialApp widget configures the overall theme and behavior of the app.
debugShowCheckedModeBanner is set to false to hide the debug banner in the app.
The home parameter specifies the widget to be displayed as the home screen of the app.
Scaffold Widget:

The Scaffold widget represents a basic material design layout structure for the app.
It provides an app bar and a body for content.
AppBar Widget:

The AppBar widget represents the top app bar that contains the title.
The title parameter sets the title text to "I Am Rich".
The background color parameter sets the background color of the app bar to black.
backgroundColor Property:

The background color property of the Scaffold widget sets the background color of the entire screen to purple.
Center Widget:

The Center widget aligns its child widget in the center of the screen.
It is used as the body of the Scaffold widget.
Image Widget:

The Image widget displays an image.
The image parameter is set to NetworkImage with the URL of the image to be displayed.
In this case, the image is fetched from 'https://flutter.dev/images/flutter-logo-sharing.png'.
This code creates a simple Flutter app that displays an image centered on a purple background with a black app bar containing the title "I Am Rich".
